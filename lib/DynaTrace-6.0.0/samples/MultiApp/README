MultiApp Sample
---------------

This sample demonstrates the principles of tagging over sockets with the
dynaTrace ADK. There are implementations of the same application for the
following platforms available:

 - Native/: a C++ implementation
 - Java/:   a Java implementation
 - DotNet/: a .NET implementation (only available on Windows)

The application itself is a console application, offering you  to either 
start a server or submit a request to the server.  Hostname and port are
hardcoded in the sources. A request consists of two 64-bit values, while
the response is a single 64-bit value, the product of the values sent.
